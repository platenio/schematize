    The `unevaluatedItems` keyword defines a subschema for all items of an array instance that
    aren't validated against another subschema.

    This keyword only applies to items in the array instance that aren't validated against the
    `prefixItems`, `items`, `contains`, `*Of`, or conditional keywords. If an item isn't otherwise
    validated by another keyword, it's validated against the `unevaluatedItems` subschema.

    When you want to disallow any items that aren't otherwise validated, set this keyword to
    `false`. When you want to allow items that aren't otherwise validated, set this keyword to
    `true`.

    This allows you to define schemas for array instances that are extensible. When you want to
    make an array instance's schema extensible, use this keyword. When you don't wnat the schema to
    be extensible, use the `items` keyword instead.

    Don't use the `unevaluatedItems` keyword with the `items` keyword. Only use one or the other
    for a specific instance.

    This keyword only applies to array instances.
