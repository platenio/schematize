    The `unevaluatedProperties` keyword defines a subschema for all properties of an object
    instance that aren't validated against another subschema.

    If a the name of an object instance's property is a key in the `properties` keyword, matches a
    pattern in the `patternProperties` keyword, is validated through schema composition or
    conditional logic, it isn't validated against this keyword.

    When you want to disallow any properties that aren't otherwise validated, set this keyword to
    `false`. When you want to allow properties that aren't otherwise validated, set this keyword to
    `true`.

    This allows you to define schemas for object instances that are extensible. When you want to
    make an object instance's schema extensible, use this keyword. When you don't want the schema
    to be extensible, use the `additionalProperties` keyword instead.

    Don't use the `unevaluatedProperties` keyword with the `additionalProperties` keyword. Only use
    one or the other for a specific instance.

    This keyword only applies to object instances.
