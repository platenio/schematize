    The `writeOnly` keyword is an annotation indicating whether an instance for a schema or
    subschema is retrievable.

    When `writeOnly` is `true`, it indicates that users may not read this value. It's typically
    used with APIs to provide information to a client integration where a client may set the value
    but not retrieve it.

    To define that an instance may be retrieved but not set, use the `readOnly` keyword instead.
