    The `description` keyword defines an annotation keyword that provides a contextual explanation
    for a schema or subschema.

    When you define this keyword, it's used by integrating tools. In particular, for editors that
    understand JSON Schema, the value is shown when a user hovers on a key in a JSON or YAML
    document that uses the schema.

    Some integrations may respect Markdown for this value, but not all of them do. It's best
    practice to specify this value as a plain string without any newlines.

    When using the Schematize dialect, you can provide more description for your schema's documentation
    with the `description` property of the `schematize` keyword. When you use a Schematize-compatible
    tool to generate your documentation and publish your schema, it munges the `description` key
    for your schema to include a link to the documentation at the end of the description unless
    you specify the `no_add_docs_url` property as `false` in the `schematize` keyword.
