    The `title` keyword defines an annotation to identify the schema or subschema.

    When you define this keyword, it's used by integrating tools. In particular, for editors that
    understand JSON Schema, the value is shown when a user hovers on a key in a JSON or YAML
    document that uses the schema.

    Some integrations may respect Markdown for this value, but not all of them do. It's best
    practice to specify this value as a plain string.
