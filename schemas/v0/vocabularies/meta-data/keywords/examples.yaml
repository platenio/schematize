    The `examples` keyword defines an array of examples for a schema or subschema. These values
    aren't used for validation. They're useful for showing users of a schema how it works and how
    they can use it.

    The JSON Schema documentation reccomends that every entry in the keyword's array should
    validate against the schema it's defined but notes that this isn't strictly required.

    In the Schematize documentation, the examples are often one level up and include the current
    schema as a key-value pair rather than just the value for the schema. This enables the examples
    to include the `schematize` keyword for each example, defining leading prose to accompany the
    example in the generated documentation.
