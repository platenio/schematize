    The `readOnly` keyword is an annotation indicating whether an instance for a schema or
    subschema is settable.

    When `readOnly` is `true`, it indicates that users may not set this value. It's typically used
    with APIs to provide information to a client integration where a client may retrieve the value
    but not set it.

    To define that an instance may be set but not retrieved, use the `writeOnly` keyword instead.
