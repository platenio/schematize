schematize:
  description: |
    Use this option to define a short overview for an entry's documentation. Schematize treats this
    additional text as Markdown.

    When rendering the documentation, Schematize inserts the synopsis after the title heading for
    a top-level entry. If this keyword isn't defined, Schematize uses the value of the entry's
    `description` keyword instead.

    Schematize only uses the synopsis for top-level entries documented on a page. Schematize
    ignores this keyword when rendering subschemas of the top-level entry.
  summary: |
    Use this option to define extended text for an entry's documentation. Schematize treats this
    additional text as Markdown. Schematize only uses this keyword for top-level entries in the
    documentation, not for subschemas.
