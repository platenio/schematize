title:            Documentation description
description:      Defines extended text for how an entry's documentation renders.
type:             string
default:          ''
contentMediaType: text/markdown

examples:
  - description: |
      This is a _paragraph_ describing the entry.

      You can use multiple paragraphs in the `description` value.

      - You can also use lists
      - and any other arbitrary markup.
    schematize:
      heading:
        title: Example 1 - Block with Trailing Newline
        attributes:
          toc_text: 1. Block with Trailing Newline
  - description: |-
      In this example, the trailing whitespace is trimmed.

      It's still multiple lines and paragraphs.
    schematize:
      heading:
        title: Example 2 - Trimmed Block
        attributes:
          toc_text: 2. Trimmed Block

  description: |
    Use this option to define extended text for an entry's documentation. Schematize treats this
    additional text as Markdown.

    When Schematize renders the documentation for a top-level schema entry, it creates a section
    called "Description" (internationalized) after the synopsis and metadata. Schematize renders
    the prose for that section using the following procedure.

    1. If this option is defined, Schematize uses it for the prose.
    1. If [`schematize.summary`] is defined, Schematize uses that value for the prose.
    1. If [`description`] is defined, Schematize uses that value for the prose.
    1. Schematize uses the default text for the entry, if defined in the translation keys.
    1. Schematize renders the heading without any prose.

    For best results, use the literal block scalar syntax by appending a `|` after the key name and
    placing the text on the next line indented at least two spaces.

    default:
      description: |
        The default value is an empty string (`""`) and has no effect on the documentation. Only
        when this option is set to a non-empty string does it override the schema's entry for the
        [`description`][01] keyword.

    examples:
      description: |
        These examples demonstrate how you can use YAML syntax to define a multi-line description.
        For best results, use the literal block scalar syntax by appending a `|` after the key name
        and placing the text on the next line indented at least two spaces.
