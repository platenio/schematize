  #       Use this option to define a specific ID to use for the rendered schema's section heading or
  #       details element in the documentation. When this option isn't specified, Schematize
  #       auto-generates the ID.

  #       The value for this keyword must be valid for the [`id` global HTML attribute][01]. It must
  #       not contain any whitespace.

  #       Use this option to define the text that a renderer should use for the metadata's section
  #       heading or details summary. When this value isn't specified, the renderer must use a
  #       default title, like `Schema`.

      summary:      |
        Use this option to define leading prose for the schema, inserted before the schema's
        codeblock. The value of this property can be any valid Markdown text.

        When this property is undefined or the value is an empty string, the schema codeblock has
        no leading prose.
  always:
    title:       Always Render Schema
    description: Defines whether the entry's schema should always be rendered in the documentation.
    type:        boolean
    default:     false

      title:       null
      heading:
        attributes:
          toc_md: "`always`"
      description: |
        Use this option to define whether the entry's schema should always be rendered, even when
        the entry isn't a top-level entry. By default, Schematize only renders the schema for
        top-level entries, not subschema entries for keywords.
  format_as:
    title:       Rendered Schema Format
    description: Defines the data format to render the schema as in the documentation.
    $ref:        /v0/vocabularies/schematize/format_as.json

      heading:
        attributes:

      no_more_info: true
      summary: |
        Use this option to define what data format to render for the schema in the codeblock.

        By default, the value displays as JSON. If you set this option to `yaml`, it displays as
        YAML instead.
  remove_keywords:
    title:       Keywords to Remove
    description: Defines a list of keywords to remove schema before rendering the schema codeblock.
    type:        array
    default:
      - schematize
      - examples
      - $comment
    items:
      type: string
      schematize:
        description: |
          The items in this array can be any keyword name. When you specify a keyword in the array,
          it's removed from the schema _recursively_, not just at the top-level of the schema.
    schematize:
      weight:      7
      title:       null
      heading:
        attributes:
          toc_md: "`remove_keywords`"
      description: |
        Use this option to define a list of keywords to recursively remove from the entry's schema
        before rendering it in a codeblock.

        By default, Schematize recursively removes the `schematize`, `examples`, and `$comment`
        keywords before rendering the schema as a codeblock in the documentation. This helps keep
        the schema concise without affecting the schema's validation.

        This option only affects the schema rendering as a codeblock in the documentation, not the
        rest of its presentation or the published schema itself.
  collapse:
    title:       Collapse Rendered Schema
    description: Whether the schema should be rendered as collapsible and in what state.
    default:     null
    type:
      - boolean
      - 'null'
    schematize:
      weight:      6
      title:       null
      heading:
        attributes:
          toc_md: "`collapse`"
      description: |
        The `collapse` property of the `render_schema` option defines whether the codeblock for an
        entry's schema should be rendered in a details element instead of a normal HTML section. It
        also defines whether the details element should render collapsed, with only the summary
        showing, or open with the description list visible.

        This property can be any of three values:

        - `null` (default): When you set `collapse` to `null`, the schema is rendered in a section
          with the `title` as a heading.
        - `true`: When you set `collapse` to `true`, the schema is rendered in a details element
          with the `title` as the summary element's text. The details element is rendered with the
          `open` attribute set to `false`, so the leading prose from `description` and the schema
          codeblock are hidden when the page loads.
        - `false`: When you set `collapse` to `false`, the schema is rendered in a details element
          with the `title` as the summary element's text. The details element is rendered with the
          `open` attribute set to `true`, so the leading prose from `description` and the schema
          codeblock are visible when the page loads.

schematize:
  url:         /vocabularies/schematize/render_schema
  description: |
    The `render_schema` option defines whether and how Schematize should render the entry's schema
    as a codeblock in the documentation. You can specify the value either as a boolean, to prevent
    the section from rendering or render it with the default options, or as an object with specific
    settings.

    By default, Schematize renders the schema for every top-level entry in the documentation. The
    schema is rendered as a highlighted codeblock beneath a section heading.
  type_descriptions:
    boolean: |
      When the value for this option is `true`, Schematize renders the entry's schema with the
      default options. When the value for this option is `false`, Schematize skips rendering the
      entry's schema.
    object: |
      When the value for this option is an object, you can override the default settings for how an
      entry's schema renders in the documentation.
  summary: |
    This option defines whether and how Schematize should render the entry's schema as a codeblock
    in the documentation. You can specify the value either as a boolean, to prevent the section
    from rendering or render it with the default options, or as an object with specific settings.
