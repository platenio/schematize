title:       More Info Link
description: Defines whether the entry should have more information link when referenced.
default:     <prefix> [<title>](<url>)
type:
  - boolean
  - string

schematize:
  description: |
    Set this option for control over whether and how to link to more information for reference
    entries in the documentation. This value is used when rendering a schema entry that _only_
    defines annotation metadata, the `schematize` keyword, and the `$ref` keyword. If an entry
    defines any other values - if it's not relying entirely on the reference for validation - this
    option doesn't apply.
  type_descriptions:
    boolean: |
      By default and when this option is set to `true`, Schematize adds a paragraph after the
      referenced schema's summary that ends with a link to the documentation for the referenced
      schema. When this option is set to `false`, no paragraph or link is added after the summary.

      The default paragraph uses this Markdown template:

      ```markdown
      <prefix> [<title>](<url>)
      ```

      The `<prefix>` may be localized. If not, the default prefix is `For more information, see`.
      The `<title>` is the title of the referenced schema. The `<url>` is the URL linking to the
      documentation for the referenced schema.

      For example, given the following schemas:

      ```yaml
      ---
      $id:  /v0/vocabularies/schematize/keywords/enum.json
      type: object
      properties:
        title:
          $ref: /v0/vocabularies/schematize/title.json
      ---
      $id:              /v0/vocabularies/schematize/title.json
      title:            Alternate Documentation Title
      description:      Defines an alternate title for the entry in the documentation.
      type:             string
      contentMediaType: text/markdown
      schematize:
        url: /vocabularies/schematize/title
      ```

      The reference for the `title` property in the `enum.json` schema would resolve to:

      ```markdown
      Defines an alternate title for the entry in the documentation.

      For more information, see [Alternate Documentation Title](/vocabularies/schematize/title).
      ```
    string: |
      When the value for this option is set as a string, Schematize uses that string as the
      template when adding the link to the referenced schema's documentation. Schematize
      implementations replace the following strings in the template:

      - `<prefix>` is replaced with either the string `For more information, see` or a localized
        string to the same effect. You can provide a custom prefix by omitting the `<prefix>`
        string from the template.
      - `<title>` is replaced by the title of the referenced schema's documentation.
      - `<url>` is replaced by the URL to the referenced schema's documentation.

    Blah.
