    Set this option to ensure a deterministic ordering for items in the generated documentation.

    If you don't specify this option, ordering for entries is not necessarily deterministic.

    Schematize orders entries with a lower weight before entries with a higher weight, then all
    unweighted entries. If the unweighted entries are properties, they're added in alphabetical
    order.

    Set this option to ensure a deterministic ordering for items in the generated documentation.
