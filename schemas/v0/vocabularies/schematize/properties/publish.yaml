    title: Add Documentation URLs
    description: >-
      Whether the URL to the entry in the schema should be appended to the description.
    type:
      - boolean
      - string
    enum:
      - true

          toc_md: "`add_docs_url`"
      description: |
        The `add_docs_url` publish option defines whether the URL to a schema entry should be
        appended to the description keyword for the entry.

        When this option is set to `true`, Schematize appends the bare link to the entry's
        documentation heading to the `description` keyword. If the `description` keyword is empty,
        the URL is used as the description. If the keyword has any content, the URL is added after
        two newlines. When this option is set to `false`, no URL is appended.

  remove_schematize:
    title: Remove schematize keyword
    description: >-
      Whether the schematize keyword should be recursively removed from the published schema.
    type: boolean

        attributes:
          toc_md: "`remove_schematize`"
      description: |
        The `remove_schematize` publish option defines whether the `schematize` keyword should be
        recursively removed from the published schema. When this option is set to `true`,
        Schematize removes the `schematize` keyword from the schema before publishing. This only
        affects the published schema, not the documentation. When this option is set to `false`,
        the `schematize` keyword remains in the published schema.

  remove_examples:
    title: Remove examples keyword
    description: >-
      Whether the examples keyword should be recursively removed from the published schema.
    type: boolean
    default: true
    schematize:
      heading:
        attributes:
          toc_md: "`remove_examples`"
      description: |
        The `remove_examples` publish option defines whether the `examples` keyword should be
        recursively removed from the published schema. When this option is set to `true`,
        Schematize removes the `examples` keyword from the schema before publishing. This only
        affects the published schema, not the documentation. When this option is set to `false`,
        the `examples` keyword remains in the published schema.

  schema_format:
    title: Published schema data format
    description: >-
      The data format to use for the published schema.
    type: string
    enum:

      - yaml
    schematize:
      heading:
        attributes:
          toc_md: "`schema_format`"
      description: |
        The `schema_format` publish option defines whether the schema should be published as YAML
        or JSON. Schematize uses the following procedure to determine which format to use, moving
        to the next step if the format hasn't been determined yet:

        1. If this option is defined, Schematize publishes the schema as this format.
        1. If the Schematize configuration defines the [`publishing.schema_format`][01] setting,
           Schematize publishes the schema as that format.
        1. If the [`$id`][02] keyword ends with the `.json` or `.json` extension, Schematize
           publishes the schema as that format.
        1. Schematize publishes the schema as JSON.

  schema_uri_override:
    title: Override $schema URI
    description: >-
      The URI to use for the $schema keyword.
    format: uri
    type:
      - boolean
      - string
    default: true
    schematize:
      heading:
        attributes:
          toc_md: "`schema_uri_override`"
      description: |
        The `schema_uri_override` publish option defines a replacement URI for the published
        schema's `$schema` keyword. You can use this option to convert the URI for the `$schema`
        keyword to another schema. This is useful when you're authoring with the Schematize schema
        but want to publish a maximally compatible schema.
      type_descriptions:
        boolean: |
          When the value for this option is `true`, the `$schema` keyword is replaced with
          `https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema`. When the value for this option is
          `false`, the URI isn't replaced.
        string: |
          When the value for this option is a string, it's used to replace the value for the
          `$schema` keyword.

schematize:
  description: |
    The `publish` option defines whether and how the schema should be published.
  type_descriptions:
    boolean: |
      When the value for this option is `true`, the schema is published with the default options.
      When the value is `false`, the schema isn't published.
    object: |
      When the value for this option is an object, you can control how the schema is published in
      more detail.
  summary: |
    Use the `publish` option to define whether and how the schema should be published. You can set
    this value to `true` to publish the schema with default values, `false` to prevent the schema
    from publishing, or as an object to control how the schema publishes.
