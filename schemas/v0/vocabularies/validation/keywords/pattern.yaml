  description: |
    The `pattern` keyword defines a regular expression pattern that a string instance must match.
    The regular expression syntax is [ECMA 262][01] with Unicode support.

    When this keyword is specified, an instance is valid when the pattern matches _anywhere_ in the
    string. To ensure the pattern is checked against the entire string instead of only a subset,
    make sure to use the `^...$` syntax, wrapping your pattern in the beginning and end of content
    anchors.

    This keyword only applies to string instances.

    For more information about regular expressions and JSON Schema, see [Regular Expressions][02].
