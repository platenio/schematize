    The `minLength` keyword defines the minimum valid length of a string instance by character
    count. If defined, the value for this keyword must be a positive integer. If specified with
    the `maxLength` keyword, this value must also be less than the value of `maxLength`.

    If an instance has fewer characters than this keyword's value, the instance is invalid.

    This keyword only applies to string instances.
