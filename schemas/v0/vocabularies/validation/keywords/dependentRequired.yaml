    The `dependentRequired` keyword defines properties that are mandatory when an object instance
    includes another property.

    If defined, this keyword must be a set of key-value pairs where:

    - The key is the name of a property.
    - The value is an array of unique property names that are mandatory when the object instance
      includes a property with the same name as the key.

    If two properties are required to be used together if either of them is specified, define
    each property as a key for this keyword and include the other property in the value array.

    To apply an entire subschema when an object instance includes specific keywords, use the
    `dependentSchemas` keyword instead.

    This keyword only applies to object instances.
