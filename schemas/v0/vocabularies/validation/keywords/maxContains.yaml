    The `maxContains` keyword defines the maximum number of entries an array instance may have
    that validate against the subschema defined by the `contains` keyword. If defined, the value
    for this keyword must be a positive integer. If specified with the `minContains` keyword, this
    value must also be greater than the value of `minContains`.

    If the number of entries in an array instance that validate against the `contains` subschema is
    greater than this value, the instance is invalid.

    This keyword only applies to array instances.
