    The `minContains` keyword defines the minimum number of entries an array instance must have
    that validate against the subschema defined by the `contains` keyword. If defined, the value
    for this keyword must be a positive integer. If specified with the `maxContains` keyword, this
    value must also be less than the value of `maxContains`.

    If the number of entries in an array instance that validate against the `contains` subschema is
    less than this value, the instance is invalid.

    This keyword only applies to array instances.
