    The `const` keyword defines a single valid value for an instance. The value may be of any type.

    When you define this keyword, an instance is only valid if its value is identical to the value
    defined for the keyword. If the value is anything else, the instance is invalid.

    To require an instance to always be one of a list of valid values, use the `enum` keyword
    instead. Don't define both the `const` and `enum` keywords together. Only specify one or the
    other.
