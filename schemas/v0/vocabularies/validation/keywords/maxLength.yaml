    The `maxLength` keyword defines the maximum valid length of a string instance by character
    count. If defined, the value for this keyword must be a positive integer. If specified with
    the `minLength` keyword, this value must also be greater than the value of `minLength`.

    If an instance has more characters than this keyword's value, the instance is invalid.

    This keyword only applies to string instances.
