    The `not` keyword defines a subschema that an instance must not validate against.

    When this keyword is defined, the instance is validated against the subschema. If the instance
    validates against the schema, the instance is invalid.

    Use this keyword to forbid an instance from meeting a subschema or to invert another keyword.
