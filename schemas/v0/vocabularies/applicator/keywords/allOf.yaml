  description: |
    The `allOf` keyword defines an array of subschemas that an instance must validate against.

    When you define this keyword, every item in the array must be a valid subschema. The instance
    is only valid when it validates against every subschema in the array.

    This keyword is particularly useful for combining multiple conditional subschemas with the
    `if`, `else`, and `then` keywords.
