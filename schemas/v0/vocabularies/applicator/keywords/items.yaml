    The `items` keyword defines a subschema that every entry in an array instance must validate
    against. The value of this keyword can be any valid subschema.

    Every entry in the list for an array instance is checked individually against the `items`
    subschema for the array. If any entry is invalid against that subschema, the entire array is
    invalid.

    This keyword only applies to array instances.
