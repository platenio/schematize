  description: |
    The `additionalProperties` keyword defines a subschema that all properties of an object
    instance must validate against when the property isn't validated by the `properties` or
    `patternProperties` keywords.

    To explicitly allow all additional properties, set `additionalProperties` to `true`. To
    disallow addititional properties, set `additionalProperties` to `false`.
    
    Using the `additionalProperties` keyword can make it difficult to extend a schema. The
    `additionalProperties` keyword only recognizes properties defined in the same subschema, which
    prevents schema composition from defining additional valid properties. When you want to extend
    an object instance's schema that was defined with `additionalProperties`, you must redeclare
    the object's schema in full.
    
    To support schema extension, use the `unevaluatedProperties` keyword instead. Don't use the
    `additionalProperties` keyword with the `unevaluatedProperties` keyword. Only use one or the
    other for a specific instance.

    This keyword only applies to object instances.
