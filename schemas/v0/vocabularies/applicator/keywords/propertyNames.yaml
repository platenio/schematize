    The `propertyNames` keyword defines a subschema to validate the _names_ of an object instance's
    properties against, rather than the propery values. By default, the names of an object's
    properties aren't validated, though they must be strings.

    When you define this keyword, an object instance is only valid if every property name validates
    against the subschema. You don't need to define the `type` keyword as `string` for this
    subschema, because it's implied. You can't define the `type` keyword as any other value or the
    subschema itself is invalid for the keyword.
