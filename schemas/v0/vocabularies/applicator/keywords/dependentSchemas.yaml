    The `dependentSchemas` keyword defines subschemas that apply to an object instance when it
    includes specific properties.

    If defined, this keyword must be a set of key-value pairs where:

    - The key is the name of a property.
    - The value is a subschema that applies to the entire object when it includes a property with
      the same name as the key.

    This keyword only applies to object instances.
