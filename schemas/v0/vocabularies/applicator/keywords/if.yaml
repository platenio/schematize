    The `if` keyword defines a subschema that is used for conditional application of subschemas
    defined by the `then` and `else` keywords.

    When this keyword is defined, the instance is compared to the subschema. When the instance
    validates against the subschema, the instance must also validate against the `then` keywords
    subschema if it's defined. When the instance isn't valid against this keyword's subschema, the
    instance must validate against the `else` keyword's subschema if it's defined.

    If this keyword is defined without the `then` or `else` keyword, it doesn't affect validation
    for the instance. If the `then` or `else` keywords are defined without this keyword, they don't
    affect validation for the instance.

    To define multiple conditionals together, specify each set of conditionals as items in the
    `allOf` keyword's array.
