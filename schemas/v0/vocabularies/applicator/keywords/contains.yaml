    The `contains` keyword defines a subschema that at least one entry in an array instance must
    validate against. The value of this keyword can be any valid subschema.

    Every entry in the list for an array instance is checked individually against the `contains`
    subschema for the array. If no entry is valid against that subschema, the entire array is
    invalid.

    The number of entries in an array that must validate against the `contains` subschema can be
    modified by defining the `minContains` and `maxContains` keywords.

    This keyword only applies to array instances.
