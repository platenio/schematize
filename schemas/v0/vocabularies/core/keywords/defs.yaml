    The `$defs` keyword defines a set of named subschemas that can be referenced as key-value
    pairs.  When you specify a key-value pair:

    - The key represents the referable URI of a subschema and must be unique in the set of
      key-value pairs.
    - The value represents a subschema that may be referenced by the key.

    You can use this keyword to define subschemas with descriptive names that make it easier to
    understand a complex schema. Defining subschemas this way can also help reduce the repetition
    in your schema.
