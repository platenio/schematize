    The `$ref` keyword defines a reference to another schema. The value of this keyword must be a
    URI reference. When this keyword is specified as a relative URI reference, integrating tools
    resolve it against the schema's base URI.

    When this keyword is defined for an instance, integrating tools retrieve the schema and apply
    it to the instance.

    When you use this keyword to reference a schema, you may redefine the value for referenced
    annotation keywords, but not other keywords. For example, you may redefine `description`,
    `title`, or the `schematize` keywords, but not `type` or `items`. However, the way that
    integrating tools handle redefined annotations may differ between tools. Some tools may
    replace the values, others may override them.

    This keyword may apply to itself, enabling recursive schemas. It must not point to another
    reference, because that risks creating an infinite loop that can't be resolved.

    You can use this keyword to compose a schema from multiple definitions. This can make it easier
    to maintain a complex schema and enables you to reference schemas defined by other entities in
    your own schema.
