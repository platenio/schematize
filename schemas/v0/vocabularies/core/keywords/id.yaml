    The `$id` keyword defines the base URI for a schema. It's used by integrating tools to locate
    the schema and to retrieve subschemas.

    When this keyword is defined in a subschema, it indicates that the subschema is an embedded
    schema. The identifier for the embedded schema is composed by resolving the value of this
    keyword against the base URI for the schema it appears in.
