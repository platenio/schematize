    The `$dynamicRef` keyword defines a reference to to a schema or subschema at runtime. The value
    of this keyword must be a URI reference. When this keyword is specified as a relative URI
    reference to a `$dynamicAnchor`, the reference is resolved at runtime, making it easier to
    author recursive schemas like vocabularies and dialects.

    If you're referencing anything other than a `$dynamicAnchor`, use the `$ref` keyword instead.
