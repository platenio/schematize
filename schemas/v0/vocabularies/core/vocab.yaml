        This keyword defines the schema that a document must validate against. The value of this
        keyword must always be the URI for a schema or meta-schema.

      keywords:

        This keyword defines a reference to another schema. The value of this keyword must be a URI
        reference. When this keyword is specified as a relative URI reference, integrating tools
        resolve it against the schema's base URI.

        When this keyword is defined for an instance, integrating tools retrieve the schema and
        apply it to the instance.

  summary: |
    This vocabulary is functionally identical to the [JSON Schema 2020-12 Core Vocabulary][01],
    as described in [the specification][02]. The only reason it's included here is to provide
    enhanced documentation and an improved editor experience.
